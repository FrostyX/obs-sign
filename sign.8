.SH DESCRIPTION
sign adds a cryptographic signature to a file. It can add a clearsign signature
(-c option), create a detached signature (-d option), or add a signature block
to a rpm package (-r option). If no mode is specified, sign does a rpm sign
if the file name ends in ".rpm", otherwise it does a clearsign. If no
file name is specified, sign reads from stdin and writes to stdout.

One can specify a specific user or hash method with the -u and -h option.
Currently sign understands sha1 and sha256 hashes.

sign does not create signatures by itself, it needs a running signing
daemon (called signd) to do the work. The host and port information is read
from the /etc/sign.conf file.

The -k option makes sign print the keyid instead of signing a file, the
-p option makes it print the public key.

New keys can be created by using the -g option. In that case, a file name
to store the private key needs to be provided with the -P option. This
private key can be used for signing by also using the -P option with the
other modes. The pubkey of the generated key is printed to stdout.

In case a SSL certification
is also needed (e.g. for linux kernel modules), the key can be converted to
a certificate by using the -C option.

The expire time of existing keys can be extended with the -x option.

.SH OTHER OPTIONS
In some cases it it useful to specify the signature time. This can be done
with the -T option.

The -S option specifies a checksum file, it makes sign append a line containing
the checksum of the signed rpms. This can be used to speed up repository
metadata generation.

.SH SECURITY
sign needs to bind to a reserved port, it thus works only for user root
or needs to be installed suid-root. If the latter is the case, sign
grants the users specified in the "allowuser" lines of the configuration
the right to sign files.

.SH EXIT STATUS
sign returns 0 if everything worked, otherwise it returns 1 and
prints an error message to stderr.
