.TH signd 8 "Apr 2007"
.SH NAME
signd \- execute or proxy sign requests

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B signd
.RB [ -f ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
signd is a little daemon that listens for sign requests from sign,
and either calls gpg to do the signing or forwards the request
to another signd. The -f option makes signd fork on startup.

signd uses the same configuration used for sign, /etc/sign.conf.
It needs a gpg implementation that understands the
"--file-is-digest" option to work correctly.

.SH SECURITY
signd allows only connections from reserved ports and ip
addresses listed in the "allow" field of the configuration.

.SH SEE ALSO
.BR sign (8),
.BR sign.conf (5)
